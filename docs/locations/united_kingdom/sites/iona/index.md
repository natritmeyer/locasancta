## Original name

The island was originally known by its celtic name of 'Yew-isle', probably for the pagan practice of worshipping the hardy Yew tree that may have taken place there.[^1] Translated into Latin, the Gaelic "Yew-isle" became "Ioua insula" (insula being the latin word for island). Sometime in the 18th century[^2], a transcription error occured in the word _Ioua_ swapping the letter _u_ for an _n_, leaving us with _Iona_, surely amongst the most evocative of place names.
